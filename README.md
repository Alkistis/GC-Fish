# Galaxy-Clustering-Fisher

This repo contains a Fisher matrix code (Galaxy Clustering - GC). The code, GC-Fish.ipynb, is written in Python and uses the Jupyter Notebook application. 

You need to have Jupyter and the latest version of CAMB with the python wrapper to run the notebook. Further instructions can be found at the beginning of the notebook, getting it to work should be straightforward. 

The code is still under development.
